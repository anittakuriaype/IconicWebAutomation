# INSTRUCTIONS 

The main configuration is the **cypress.config.json** file. Depending on the mode of Cypress run, i.e *Stanalone* or *Node JS bundled*, this file also require changes. 
What need to be changed is also mentioned as comments within the same file. 

The **default** configuration is set to run with a **bundled Node JS** installation.

If running on standalone, uncomment the required section in the cypress.config.json file and comment out the other section.
